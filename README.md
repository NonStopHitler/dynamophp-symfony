## Installation

To install the DynamoPHP Symfony Bundle, follow these steps:

1. **Install via Composer**: Run the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   composer require nonstophitler/dynamophp-symfony
   ```

2. **Add Bundle to Kernel**: Register the bundle in your `config/bundles.php` file:

   ```php
   return [
       // Other bundles...
       NonStopHitler\DynamoPHPBundle\DynamoPHPBundle::class => ['all' => true],
   ];
   ```

3. **Configuration**: After installation, configure the bundle in your `config/packages/dynamophp.yaml` file.

## Usage

Once you have installed the bundle, you can start using it in your application.

### Basic Example

To use the DynamoPHP service, you can inject it into your controllers or services:

```php
use NonStopHitler\DynamoPHPBundle\Service\DynamoDBService;

class MyController extends AbstractController
{
    private $dynamoDBService;

    public function __construct(DynamoDBService $dynamoDBService)
    {
        $this->dynamoDBService = $dynamoDBService;
    }

    public function index()
    {
        $data = $this->dynamoDBService->getData('my_table', 'my_key');
        return $this->json($data);
    }
}
```

### Advanced Usage

For more advanced scenarios, you can use the data mapper feature to handle complex data structures. Define your models and map them to your DynamoDB tables. This approach helps maintain a clean architecture and separates your business logic from data access.

## Configuration

You can configure the DynamoPHP Symfony Bundle by editing the `config/packages/dynamophp.yaml` file. Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
dynamo_php:
    aws:
        region: 'us-east-1'
        version: 'latest'
        credentials:
            key: '%env(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)%'
            secret: '%env(AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)%'
    table:
        name: 'my_table'
        primary_key: 'my_key'
```

### Environment Variables

Make sure to set the necessary environment variables in your `.env` file:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
```
